# 08 — WiFi transmit by linking the vendor path, with the blob supplied at runtime

**Size:** large. **Risk:** low technically, high to the project's direction.
**Blocked on:** nothing. [07](07-irom.md) shipped, and the size objection below
is measured to be gone.

> **STEP 1 DONE, 2026-08-20.** The vendor transmit path **links** against a
> nat-os-shaped host with **10 shims**, not the large adapter surface this file
> predicted. See "Measured" at the end. Linking is not transmitting -- read the
> caveat there before treating this as nearly working.

*This is the route that would actually work. Read §"What it costs" before
starting it.*

## Why this exists

UM-NATOS-034 §31 corrected a claim the investigation had leaned on for four
sessions:

> both boards call the same blob with identical arguments, so any difference is
> the answer

True of `register_chipv7_phy`. **Never true of transmit.**

| | ESP-IDF | nat-os |
|---|---|---|
| PHY init | `register_chipv7_phy` in `libphy.a` | same function, same archive, arguments verified identical |
| **transmit** | `esp_wifi_80211_tx` in **`libnet80211.a`** → `libpp` → hal → registers | **hand-written register writes**, reconstructed from a disassembly of `hal_mac_txq_enable` |

`libnet80211.a` is not in this tree. `vendor/phy/` holds `libphy_natos.a` and
`libpp_natos.a` and nothing else, and `wifimac_tx()` calls no vendor function at
all.

So nat-os has never run the vendor transmit path. §29 established the
reconstruction does not radiate; this is the option of not reconstructing it.

## Why it does not fit today

```
ieee80211_output.o  (contains esp_wifi_80211_tx)   15,305 bytes .text
                                                   66 undefined symbols
libnet80211.a  .text, whole archive               196,269 bytes
nat-os IRAM free (-WiFi build)                     19,239 bytes
nat-os IRAM window, total                         131,072 bytes
```

The one object holding the entry point takes 80% of free IRAM before resolving a
single one of its 66 dependencies, and the archive's code is larger than the
whole IRAM window. **07 is a hard prerequisite, not an optimisation.**

## The shape, once 07 exists

1. Link `libnet80211.a` (and whatever it drags from `libpp`), placed in IROM.
2. Call `esp_wifi_80211_tx` rather than writing transmit registers by hand.
3. Expect to have to satisfy more of the OS adapter table than the PHY needed —
   net80211 is a protocol stack and will want timers, queues and events that
   `wifi_osi_impl.c` currently stubs or omits. `ositest` reports `0x3F ALL PASS`
   today (UM-NATOS-034 §24.6), which is a floor, not a guarantee.

### Delivering the blob from SD rather than shipping it

The reason to bother: **the repository and the flashed image contain no
Espressif binaries.** Those blobs generally cannot be freely redistributed, so
this is a real practical benefit for a public project, and it keeps
`docs/blob-free.md`'s claim literally true of what is shipped.

SD cannot be executed from — it is not memory-mapped. So SD is the *delivery*
mechanism and flash is the residence:

1. nat-os ships with no vendor binary and no WiFi transmit.
2. On demand, it reads the pre-linked blob image from SD and **writes it into a
   flash partition** — an install step, once, not per boot.
3. Thereafter it is mapped as IROM and executed from flash.

**Pre-link it at build time to a fixed address.** That avoids needing a runtime
linker: no relocation processing, no symbol resolution, no ELF loader. Load
becomes read-file, write-flash, map, call through a small entry table. The
address must be reserved in `linker.ld` so the kernel never lands there.

## What it costs

Stated plainly, because the numbers above make this sound easier than it is.

**Technically:** likely to work. It is what a working stack does.

**To the project:** nat-os's WiFi becomes ESP-IDF's WiFi. A third vendor archive,
larger than the two already here, running the protocol logic. `docs/blob-free.md`
argued that succeeding at WiFi transmit buys function and can never buy
independence — and moving the file to SD changes **where it is stored, not what
it is**. The blob still executes on the CPU with full privileges doing the actual
work.

The honest summary of the benefit: it is a *distribution* property, not an
engineering one. Debian-style non-free firmware separation. That is worth
something and it is not what "blob-free" has meant in this project's documents.

## The alternative, restated because it keeps being right

An SX1262 over SPI3 has a published register map, no PHY blob, no undocumented
calibration, and hardware already ordered. SPI3 is up and self-tested. It
delivers the same capability — a radio nat-os can transmit on — with none of the
above.

UM-NATOS-034 §17 and `docs/blob-free.md` both reached this conclusion before
this route was costed. Costing it has not changed it.

## Measured, 2026-08-20 — step 1 is done and the numbers moved a lot

### The size objection is gone

| | then | now |
|---|---|---|
| where vendor code can live | 19,239 B free IRAM | **3.3 MB IROM window** (07) |
| `libnet80211.a` `.text` | 196,269 B "larger than IRAM" | 234,616 B, irrelevant against IROM |

### The dependency surface is 10 symbols, not 66

The "66 undefined symbols" figure counted one object's references without
asking which resolve internally — the same mistake `vendor/phy/README.md`
avoided for `libphy.a`. Repeating that methodology:

```
libnet80211.a   defined internally 1189   referenced-undef 719
                TRUE EXTERNAL      206
after libpp + libcore + ROM + already-vendored blobs      32
after phy_host.o + librtc.a + libcoexist.a + newlib-nano  10
```

The residual ten:

| symbol | what it is |
|---|---|
| `free`, `puts`, `strtok` | libc; nat-os has equivalents |
| `hexstr2bin` | ten lines |
| `net80211_printf`, `mesh_printf` | route to UART or discard |
| `WIFI_EVENT`, `esp_event_handler_register` / `_unregister`, `esp_mesh_send_event_internal` | the event system — **the only genuinely new surface** |

### The link closes

`vendor/net80211/` holds the probe that proves it: `probe.c` references
`esp_wifi_80211_tx`, `net80211_host.c` supplies the ten, `probe.ld` gives a
memory layout.

```
link exit=0            0 undefined references
400d2b90 T esp_wifi_80211_tx
   text     data      bss
 545480     4113    16664
```

Reproduce with the command in this directory's README. Note `.text` is 545 KB
because the closure drags `libpp`, `libcore`, `libmesh`, `librtc`, `libcoexist`
and `libphy` — **not** net80211's 234 KB alone. nat-os already links two of
those, so the marginal cost is smaller than 545 KB but has not been separated
out. 16,664 B of `.bss` is the DRAM cost, against ~122 KB of free heap.

### The caveat that matters more than any number above

**Linking is not transmitting, and stubs that link are not stubs that work.**

The event stubs accept a registration and never deliver a callback. That is
plausibly enough for a blind `esp_wifi_80211_tx()`, which is a direct call — and
it is definitely **not** enough for scan, association or receive, all of which
are event-driven. The real scope of 08 is that difference, and it is invisible
in a symbol count. A previous run of this same measurement reported "0 undefined
references" when the link had actually failed for an unrelated reason and the
grep matched nothing; the number was only trustworthy after checking the ELF
existed and contained the symbol.

### Next, in order

1. **Reserve a flash partition** and a fixed pre-link address in `linker.ld`.
   Nothing else can be designed until the address is chosen.
2. Pre-link the closure to that address at build time — no runtime relocation.
3. SD-delivery and the flash install step (§"Delivering the blob from SD").
4. Call it, on air, and check the MT7921 sees a frame. Until step 4, none of
   the above is evidence about radiating.

---

## Step 4 — the loader, 2026-08-20. Mapped, loaded, verified. NOT called.

`kernel/blob.c` maps the region and runs the loader half. `blob` on the shell:

```
magic     N802  version 1
image     549240 bytes  of 1048576 reserved
.data     3588 B from 0x40385374 to 0x3ffd4000
.bss      16600 B at 0x3ffd5018
tx entry  0x40302b9c
loader    rc=0 (.data copied, .bss zeroed)
verify    .data 897 words, 0 mismatched;  .bss 4150 words, 0 non-zero
LOAD VERIFIED
NOT CALLED. mapping is not running.
```

Every value matches the pre-link. The MMU mapping, the cache flush, the `.data`
copy out of flash-mapped memory and the `.bss` zero all work, and the whole
range is verified rather than one word — a copy loop that returns is not
evidence it copied anything, and a single matching word would also match if the
loop had run exactly once.

**Mapping and calling are deliberately separate.** `blob map` stops after
validation. If a map is wrong, a call jumps into whatever bytes are there and
the board dies with nothing to read; every number above is obtainable before
anything executes.

### Two things this cost, both worth recording

**The byte copy faulted, and it was the same bug as this morning.** `data_lma`
points into the flash-mapped *instruction* region, which serves 32-bit aligned
accesses and nothing else. A byte loop over it raised `LoadStoreError` at
`0x4008187f`. `boot.c` hit the same class today from the other direction —
storing bytes *into* IRAM — and needed a DRAM bounce buffer. The rule worth
carrying: **if either end of a copy is instruction memory, it is a word copy**,
and the addresses and sizes get checked rather than assumed.

**The DRAM reservation had never been touched by anything.** The heap ends at
`0x3ffd3000` and the boot stack at `0x3ffd4000`, so the 32 KB reserved above it
was declared usable by `linker.ld` and had never once been written in the life
of the project. "The linker script says it is dram" is not evidence that it is
RAM. `dramtest` walks it in 1 KB steps and verifies store/read-back; it passes
across the whole reservation.

### Unexplained: two resets that stopped happening

Between the byte-copy fix and the working loader, two builds reset with
`TG0WDT_SYS_RESET` partway through the `.bss` zero. The current build does not,
across nine consecutive trials with the load fully verified and the scheduler
healthy afterwards.

**That is not the same as understanding it.** The only change between the last
failing build and the first passing one was adding an unrelated shell command,
which is a layout shift — the signature of something that moved rather than
something that was fixed. Both failing runs also followed a boot that had ended
in a kernel panic, so a stale watchdog or store state is a candidate nobody has
ruled in or out.

Recorded here because a fault that disappears when an unrelated thing moves is
this project's own definition of a latent bug, and the next person to see a
watchdog reset around this path should start here rather than from scratch.

### Next

Calling it. That needs `phy_stack_call` or an equivalent bridge — the blob is
windowed and the kernel is call0 — and PHY init must have run first, since
`esp_wifi_80211_tx` reaches the hardware through `libpp` and `libphy`. Nothing
on air until then.

---

## Step 5 — calling it. Three bugs found and fixed; not yet running.

The blob's PHY is now reachable and the call gets *into* vendor code. It does
not complete. Four faults so far, each one a different, correctly identified
cause — recorded because the sequence is the useful part.

### The architecture changed: the blob owns the whole radio stack

The blob links its own `libphy`. The kernel's `-WiFi` build linked a *second*
copy into IRAM. Two copies have two sets of `.bss`, so calibrating one and
transmitting through the other would present as a PHY that reported success and
a radio that stayed silent — a failure shape this project has already lost
sessions to.

So the kernel now initialises **the blob's** copy. `phyinit_run_at(fn)` takes
the address as a parameter and references no Espressif symbol, so `phyinit.c`
compiles into the blob-free build; `phyinit_run()` survives behind
`BOARD_HAS_WIFI`. The kernel image still contains no vendor code.

### Bug 1 — 357,940 bytes of code were missing from the image

`blob.ld` named `.text`; the vendor archives also ship `.iram1`, `.phyiram`
and six `.wifi*iram` classes. `objcopy --only-section` then dropped every one
of them. The image linked, passed its size check, loaded and verified — and the
region read back as **zeros**. First call: `IllegalInstruction` at
`0x4036e728`, inside the hole.

Fixed by naming all of them with **globs** (they arrive as `.wifi0iram.37`, so
bare names match nothing) and by dropping `--only-section` entirely. The real
guard is **`-Wl,--orphan-handling=error`**: the linker now refuses to place a
section nobody named. It immediately caught `.rodata_wlog_warning.59`.

> **Untested caveat.** These are called `*iram` because ESP-IDF keeps them in
> RAM so they stay executable while the flash cache is off. Here they are *in
> flash*. Anything running during a flash write — WiFi interrupt handlers —
> is a real risk and is unproven.

### Bug 2 — `.rodata` was in the instruction window

Vendor code reads bytes out of its own rodata. The instruction window serves
32-bit aligned accesses only. Result: `LoadStoreError`, `epc 0x40362b28`,
`excvaddr 0x4037bd0c` — squarely inside `.rodata`.

This is exactly why ESP-IDF splits flash into IROM and DROM, and `boot.c`
already maps the kernel's own `.flash.rodata` through the data cache. The blob
now gets the same split: rodata at a fixed 64 KB-aligned image offset
(`BLOB_RODATA_OFF`), mapped to `0x3F700000` at MMU entry offset 0, alongside
the code mapping at offset 64.

**`excvaddr` is now in the panic report.** Without it a `LoadStoreError` inside
a blob is a bare `epc` with no way to tell a byte access to rodata from a wild
pointer. It is what turned bug 2 from a guess into a measurement, and it cost
four lines.

### Bug 3 — the loader refused, correctly

`rc=7`: `.rodata` ends on a byte boundary (it is full of byte-granular `wlog`
strings), so `.data`'s load address was unaligned and the word-copy guard threw
the image out. Fixed by aligning the LMA. Worth noting that the guard written
"in case a separately built image stops being aligned" earned its place within
a day.

### Where it stops now

```
epc      0x403001b3   entry a1, 32   inside phy_enter_critical
excvaddr 0x3f6fffe0   32 bytes below the DROM window
```

A window-overflow spill below the stack pointer — so `a1` is not pointing at a
stack. **`rom_call3` runs the callee on the caller's stack**, which here is the
shell task's 2 KB. `phy_stack_call` switches to the dedicated 6 KB
`_phy_stack_top`, but takes only two arguments, and `register_chipv7_phy` needs
three — so `phyinit.c` calls `rom_call3` and the PHY never receives the stack
`phy_stack_prime()` prepared for it.

That inconsistency predates this work and is visible in `phyinit.c` today: it
primes a stack the call it then makes does not use.

**Fixed, and no new assembly was needed.** `phy_stack_call`'s body has always
moved `a3`, `a4` and `a5` into `a10`, `a11` and `a12` — it passes **three**
arguments. Only the prototype in `window.h` said two, which is why
`phyinit.c` could not use it for a three-argument function and reached for
`rom_call3`. Declaring what the code already did is the entire fix.

### The blob's PHY initialises

```
blob loaded. calling its register_chipv7_phy at 0x4035e110
phyinit   rc=0  result=0x00000000
phystack  1296 of 6144 bytes used
IT RETURNED. that is not evidence the radio works.
```

The stack figure is the load-bearing number. A return code of 0 would also be
produced by an early exit; 1296 bytes of nested frames is evidence that a
substantial amount of vendor code actually ran.

**This is under nat-os's own bootloader, from a kernel containing no Espressif
code.** UM-NATOS-036 gated `-WiFi` to Espressif's second stage precisely
because `register_chipv7_phy` panicked with StoreProhibited in
`phy_enter_critical` under ours. That gate covers the copy the kernel *links*;
this is the blob's copy, at different addresses, with `.data` and `.bss`
freshly loaded. Whether the gate can now be lifted is a separate question and
has not been tested — but the failure it describes did not happen here.

### Transmit: attempted, and it fails exactly where predicted

`blobtx` builds a 56-byte beacon (SSID `NATOS-BLB`, channel 6), initialises the
blob's PHY, and hands the frame to `esp_wifi_80211_tx`:

```
phyinit   rc=0
frame     56 bytes, beacon, ssid NATOS-BLB, channel 6
calling esp_wifi_80211_tx at 0x40302bac
*** KERNEL PANIC ***  exccause 28 (LoadProhibited)
epc      0x40302a36    excvaddr 0x00000054
```

Disassembled, it is unambiguous:

```
l32r   a4, ...          ; g_wifi_global_lock
l32i.n a7, a6, 0        ; a7 = obj->table   -> NULL
l32i   a7, a7, 84       ; FAULT: [0 + 0x54]
callx8 a7               ; indirect call through that table
```

A vtable dispatch through a **null function table**. Nothing populated it,
because `esp_wifi_80211_tx` is the *last* step of a driver that was never
brought up. A live PHY is necessary and nowhere near sufficient — which is what
this file predicted at the top, and now has a fault address to prove.

### The remaining sequence, named

The blob exports every entry point needed:

| symbol | address |
|---|---|
| `wifi_osi_funcs_register` | `0x4030ded4` |
| `esp_wifi_init_internal` | `0x4030e14c` |
| `esp_wifi_start` | `0x4030e404` |
| `esp_wifi_80211_tx` | `0x40302bac` |

So the order is **register the OS adapter table → init → start → transmit**, and
`kernel/wifi_osi_impl.c` already exists for the first of those (it reports
`0x3F ALL PASS`, which UM-NATOS-034 §24.6 correctly calls a floor rather than a
guarantee).

That is the real remaining scope of 08, and it is a phase rather than a step:
the OS adapter is where a protocol stack asks for timers, queues, events and
tasks, and `net80211_host.c`'s event stubs currently accept a registration and
never deliver a callback. Association and scan need those to actually work;
a bare `esp_wifi_80211_tx` may not.

**Nothing has been on air.**
